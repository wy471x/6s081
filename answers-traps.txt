1.Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0: Holds the address of the format string "%d %d\n".
a1: Holds the value 12 (result of f(8) + 1).
a2: Holds the value 13.

2.Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
Call to f in main:
14: 250d addiw a0, a0, 3
Call to g in f:
6: 250d addiw a0, a0, 3

3.At what address is the function printf located?
printf address: (ra)0x30 + (1510)5E6 = 0x616

4.What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
ra = 0x38

5.Run the following code.

	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
      
What is the output? Here's an ASCII table that maps bytes to characters.
The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
set i = 0x00726c64 to produce the same output;No changes is needed for 57616.

6.In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?

	printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
x=3 y=1
