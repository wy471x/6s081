1.Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
a0: Holds the address of the format string "%d %d\n".
a1: Holds the value 12 (result of f(8) + 1).
a2: Holds the value 13.

2.Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
Call to f in main:
14: 250d addiw a0, a0, 3
Call to g in f:
6: 250d addiw a0, a0, 3

3.At what address is the function printf located?
